## Handling Dead Player Agents

I'd really like to move them to a separate list.
Maybe even separate object types.

The expectation is that they will be rendered differently.
For example, the agent sprite might be replaced with a brief explosion animation.

If corpses are displayed, they should be on a layer below where the player agents are drawn. That would give us *three levels* now:

1. Corpses
2. Player agents
3. Player agent decorations

Then we handle death by constructing a new DeadAgent object with the same name as the former PlayerAgent. It might have the same sprite, even.
For now, since there are no sprites, we just want to draw a gray circle, the name of the bot, and its aim direction, mainly as debugging aids.
Then maybe implement animation by just having the "sprite" fade away.

Note that this means we probably want to draw the name on the bottom layer, 
as well as the disc.

So continuing with the death handler:

1. Construct a new DeadAgent object from the dead PlayerAgent.
2. Remove the agent's body from the physics world.
3. Remove the agent sprite from the sprite list.
4. Add the dead agent to the dead agents list.
5. Render dead agents, sprite discs, and sprite decorations, in that order.

Someday we might want exploding bots to be a hazard to other bots, in which case there will be a time when the dead bot is still involved in collisions.

The big question is whether we really want a separate dead bot class, 
or rather a single bot class that can be in multiple states.
I am now thinking the *state machine* approach is probably a better one.

Currently there's only two states an agent can be in: `Alive` and `Dead`.
But later there could be lots more. 
Even the `Dead` state might want to be split into `Dead1`...`Dead8` or whatever, to handle gradual elimination from the game. For example, if we want the appearance to change gradually, or we want explosion damage to decrease over time.

That leads to the question of how agent state interacts with animations.
A *state* might actually be a complex object capable of internal transitions.
In that case, it needs a final transition to another meta-state. 
For example, what does `Dead.8` transition into?

There can only be one runner responsible for state transitions.
It queries the state for its next transition, given environmental data (e.g., a reference back to the controller). The state may respond "Done!", in which case what would we do next?

There has to be a top level transition table that says "Enter meta-state `Dead`; on `Dead.done`, enter meta-state `Eliminated`," or something like that.

The idea is that on entering state `Dead`, there is an assignment like:
```
sprite.stateData = {counter: 0};
```
And the controller enters a new state by recursively calling something like 
`stateData.next()`.

This means we are running an RTN, but hopefully one with a very strictly bounded stack.

So stuff happens to an agent according to its current state.
Then after all that, we check to see if its state changes.
Then more stuff happens according to the updated state.
Both `update` and `render` would be sensitive to the agent's state.

There has to be a uniform state API.
Currently that is just a single `next()` method.

The main problem is that if there is just a single `state` property that we plug complex sub-states into, they don't know what to transition to when they are done. 
There really has to be a *stack* of states. So the top-level `next()` can call the embedded `next()`, and if it returns "Done!", then the top-level transition table says what to replace the sub-state with.

So there's `PlayerAgent.prototype.next`, and also `PlayerAgent.prototype.state`, which is inhabited by an object that also has a `next` method.
```
next = () => {
	let rslt = this.state.next();
	while (rslt === Q_DONE) {
		this.state = State.create(this.delta(this.state.id));
		this.state.next();
	}
}
```
So state class `Alive` would only return `Q_DONE` when the agent's health dropped to zero or less. Then it would transition to `Dead`.
And state class `Dead` would only return `Q_DONE` after an internal counter had reached a predefined limit. Then it would transition to `Eliminated`.
State `Eliminated` would trigger cleanup of the agent.
Meaning some top-level game logic in `update` would have to ask "if X is in state Eliminated, remove it from the list, or always skip it in update and render, or whatever."

The state API might need to include its own `update` and `render` methods as well.
I guess `update` is really where it would make its own internal transitions.

Changes in health will happen in *collision handlers* (mainly when agents collide with weapons and ordnance). These will be called by the physics engine during its `update` step. And that, in turn, happens at the very end of the main `update` step.
Taken all together, that means that an agent will actually die in between the end of the update step and the beginning of the next render step.
That doesn't seem right...

If you die during the update step, then we want you to appear dead in the immediately following render step.
To make that happen, we would have to do the physics step, then the sprite step.
So the new order is:

1. Advance physics simulation
2. Bot update: execute program for 1 chronon (if in state Alive)
3. Render

It's easy to imagine other states, especially as ways of implementing debuffs.
Being stunned or slept would be just like being dead, but on `Q_DONE` you would transition back to `Alive`.
But for right now we just have two states: Dead and NotDead.

### StateDead

I guess the only property of a dead agent is a counter to say when to clean up.
So more or less:
```
next: () => {
	if (--counter === 0) {
		return Q_DONE;
	}
	return Q_NOT_DONE;
}
```

In the long term, StateDead might come with its own sprite animation.
And it certain comes with a unique state id (`Q_DEAD`, presumably).

Oh, and I guess it needs a `position` property, since that's no longer available from the physics body. Though in fact there is no longer any reason to destroy the physics body, so maybe that's not a problem going forward.

### StateNotDead

This would have a `Matter.Body` member, and a `health` property, at the very least. Currently we also have stuff like `aim` and position and motor vectors, which are really redundant with the body data.
There will be lots more later, corresponding to various agent "loadouts".
More importantly, there will be a `program` property.

An update step for a not-dead agent will involve:

1. Checking state and transitioning if necessary
1. Running the program for `cpuSpeed` cycles
2. Updating the physics body properties accordingly

It may be that the program is allowed to update physics properties directly.

Ultimately there may be a two-step process where running the program just creates a log of side-effects, and a second stage actually evaluates the log and changes the world accordingly.

At one point I was thinking of running all active programs in parallel.
That would not be possible if agents are updated one after another.
We would have to split the master `update` function to loop through the sprite list three times:
```
update: () => {
	for (var i=0; i< n; ++i) {
		sprites[i].updateState();
	}
	interpreter.advance(sprites);
	for (var i=0; i< n; ++i) {
		sprites[i].playLog();
	}
}
```
Something like that.
Is there still any reason to do this?

No sprite can move during a chronon. 
So even though you can move your turret, it will only register sprites in the state they were in before the update.
You can fire, but your attack will only be launched at the end of the chronon.
That is, a new ordnance sprite will be created and added to the projectiles list and the physics world, but it won't start moving until the next physics update.
So all projectiles will appear to happen simultaneously, I think.

Again, all events that can damage you happen during the physics simulation step.
If we need to refine things, then we need to have several short-step/logic iterations in between frame rendering.

### StateGarbage

After you've been dead for a little while, you become garbage, which needs to be made to disappear. 
Either we actually remove all sprite data from the game, 
or we leave it like this and make sure our loops skip over all garbage sprites.
They are completely invisible and undetectable, and do no work of any sort. 
They just take up memory.
And this is a state that never emits `Q_DONE`. It's like a sink state in automata theory.


## Programming Language

I notice that JVM bytecode is a stack based language, like RoboTalk.
It doesn't look like there's a lot of `DUP`, `ROLL`, `DROP` instructions, though. Some of them exist, but don't seem to be used a lot.
Actually, on closer reading, there's a lot of finicky `dup` instructions, so I guess it isn't enough to drive people away from stack machine programming.

The key feature is *event handlers*, aka *interrupts*.

Suppose we have an event handler for colliding with a wall.
That's code that exists in the program, but the event itself happens during physics simulation.
That means that the actual event handler, the one registered with `Matter.Events`, is going to just add an event to a queue or put a message in a bot's mailbox, or something like that.

Now, it's possible to be in collision with more than one thing at once.
In a corner, you are hitting two walls. You may bump more than one other player agent. And so on.
So there's going to be multiple events, even of the same type.
Do you handle them sequentially? Only handle the first one?

First off, different events may have different *priorities*.
So on returning from your priority 1 event handler, you may immediately get bounced to your priority 2 event handler.

There should be an option to drop the remainder of the event queue.

Maybe the way to implement a collision handler is to get a list of *all* the objects you are in collision with.
That's the only reliable way to compute your best escape vector, for example.

In a stack machine, you'd have to do something like have the array length at the top of the stack.
And you'd have to have instructions for pushing the item at *stack - N*.
Also, returning from the handler would have to unwind the stack entirely.
So the arguments form a sort of *stack frame*, I guess kind of like in the JVM?

The actual items on the stack would have to be some kind of *object references*, where the objects would live somewhere else. 
Note that now we need some sort of *garbage collection*.
In this particular case, since the objects are created by the game engine, and are not needed after the event has been handled, they could actually be included in the stack frame, or automatically destroyed as soon as their reference goes out of scope.

Note that if `goto` is allowed from inside an interrupt handler to outside it, then we can be in very serious trouble.
We'd have to be able to analyze all `goto` targets and determine which ones would cause an exit from the current block.

### Collisions

Are collisions the only game events that get reported by the physics engine?
So far, I think that is the case.

The engine gives us a list of affected pairs. 
In addition, there are two distinct events that we may want to collapse.

1. `collisionActive`
2. `collisionStart`

So we have to scan the lists of affected pairs for both types, 
and deliver the relevant records to each affected object's event queue.
Ideally they would be ordered by *timestamp* as well,
but for now we may as well consider events occurring in the same engine step to have been simultaneous.

Maybe we can just react to `collisionActive` events?

The information we want to deliver with each collision:

1. Who/what we are colliding with.
2. Direction of the collision?
3. Force of the collision?

Not exactly sure how we calculate these.
Really, the most important direction is the direction to the other sprite, and we get that from the sprite itself.

So there has to be a way to register a handler for a given event.
The VM will come with a set of fixed memory locations that will hold code addresses. So something like:
```
STORE collision, OnBump
```
Where `OnBump` must be the label of an address.
It should also be possible to *compute addresses* and store the result of the computation.

### Memory Model

So, apart from the stack, there will be a collection of fixed memory locations, AKA *registers*, where we can store stuff.
Among these would be the *interrupt handlers*, 
and *hardware registers* like `aim`.
There also needs to be some sort of user memory.
I guess any symbol that isn't a register name or an interrupt name could be interpreted as a memory location.

It should also be possible to declare a constant data area.
That is, the user should be able to declare named constants, for code readability.

I guess we can always use tagged symbols.
Like `@foo` is the address of label `foo`; `@(foo + 6)` is the address 6 after `foo`, etc.
And maybe `!collision` is an interrupt handler register,
and `&aim` is a register, I dunno.

In RW it was necessary to distinguish literal register names from the value stored there, so you could store a register name in another register.
Maybe that will be necessary here as well?

## Programming Language

The main goal is to have a language that makes it clear how many "CPU cycles" a given program fragment is going to consume.
So the simplicity of assembler, bytecode, and three-address code is appealing.
But we do not require the efficiency,
nor do we need to worry too much about how many real cycles our interpreter is taking up per instruction. 

For example, there's a lot of work going on in a function call: stack frame allocation, pushing parameters, saving the return address, and so on.
And compiling an access via a path through a struct leaves us with something quite simple at run-time, but if any part of that path involves de-referencing a pointer, then suddenly there's more instructions.
Maybe we don't care so much, here?

Also, in TAC, we'd have to compile out an array access into a number of steps, possibly. But we can just say "`[]` is an operator, like any other".

### Are registers just storage locations?

I've written register storage as two steps:
```
* 		driveX 	-1 		_T4
Store 	driveX 	_T4 	_
```
This is because, in the back of my head, I know that storing to the drive register is a method call, not simply an assignment. 
But that's under the hood. How complicated would the interpreter become if we allowed direct storage in TAC?
```
*	driveX	-1	driveX
```


## Garbage Collection

Note that we do not want to just transition bullets to state `Eliminated` and then leave them around and just skip over them. 
Memory will leak away really quickly this way.
Bullets definitely want to be deallocated once they have died.


## Classes and Modules

We're getting to a point where the PlayerAgent code wants to be split off in its own separate module.
What other modules do we want?
