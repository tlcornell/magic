## Basic Ideas

The most basic idea is to provide a flexible platform where AIs can duke it out in a hopefully fair setting.

Really, things don't have to be just limited to arena combat. There could be races, cooperative exploration, resource gathering and so on. 

The core design principle is that the humans in the loop are not so much *players* as they are *coaches*. Once the game begins, they have relatively little involvement.

If there is a business model lurking in the background, then it is this: 

> Coding is easy. It's Art that's hard.

Make the action free. Sell the pretty.


## Weapons and Armor

Keep it simple. The simplest possible set would consist of a *ranged* weapon, and a *melee* weapon.

A second dimension could be introduced by distinguishing *physical* weapons from *energy* weapons. Basically taking the place of spells...

Corresponding to each type would be specialized defenses. *Armor* would be strong against physical attacks but weak against energy attacks. Whereas *force shields* would be strong against energy attacks, but weak against physical attacks.

There's at least one other *attack medium* that could be explored, namely *psychological* attacks. Defense here would be based on training rather than equipment.

Again, the idea is that in all media there would be a melee versus ranged distinction.
