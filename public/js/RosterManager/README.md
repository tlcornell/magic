# README for the Status Display Module

This module contains the code for building and running the status display, 
which lives next to the arena and displays current stats (health, energy, etc.) for all the player agents in the roster.

It also functions as a roster selector widget. For now, this is the only way
to add agents to the roster for the current game.
